# What is the difference between res header and res setHeader?

This two methods do exactly the same thing, set the headers HTTP response. The only difference is res. setHeader() allows you only to set a singular header and res. header() will allow you to set multiple headers.

#

response.setHeader() allows you only to set a singular header.

response.writeHead() will allow you to set pretty much everything about the response head including status code, content, and multiple headers.

# Parameters: It accepts three parameters as mentioned above and described below:

statusCode <number>: It accepts the status codes that are of number type.
statusMessage <string>: It accepts any string that shows the status message.
headers <Object>: It accepts any function, array, or string.

# What is buffer vs stream in node JS?

- A buffer is a temporary memory that a stream takes to hold some data until it is consumed.

- A buffer is a space in memory (typically RAM) that stores binary data. In Node. js, we can access these spaces of memory with the built-in Buffer class. Buffers store a sequence of integers, similar to an array in JavaScript. Unlike arrays, you cannot change the size of a buffer once it is created.

# What is middleware?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

var express = require('express'); var app = express();
app.get('/', function(req, res, next) { next());
})
app.listen(3000);

# // this function(res, res, next) is middleware

# .get HTTP method for which the middleware function applies.# / Path (route) for which the middleware function applies.

# next -- Callback argument to the middleware function, called "next" by convention.

res.send() // HTML
res.sendFile() // file
res.json() // json

Node JS

1. Run Time + APi
2. Async
3. Non-Blocking I/O

Node js not a web server

Use express to make it web server

Use Electron to make application

Node is usefull in Heavy I/O

## Small code

1.  [
    index.js
    import { sum, diff } from "./lib.js";
    console.log(sum(4, 5), diff(7, 9));

lib.js
const sum = (a, b) => {
return a + b;
};
const diff = (a, b) => {
return a - b;
};
export { sum, diff };

package.json
{
"type": "module"
}

]

2.  [
    lib.js
    exports.sum = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
    };
    exports.diff = (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
    };

// module.exports.sum=sum;
// module.exports.diff=diff;

index.js
const lib = require("./lib.js");
console.log(lib.sum(4, 5), lib.diff(7, 9));
]

Each file in Node is called module

Peviously node support common js( require ) module
but now it also support EJS module
